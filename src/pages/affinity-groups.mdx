# Affinity Groups 

oSTEM strives to make visible and give voice to the underrepresented people within the LGBTQ+ STEM 
community. We believe that by connecting you with each other, with mentors and resources, and by 
showcasing you and your accomplishments within broader STEM spaces, we can improve representation.

Currently, the Diversity and Inclusion team hosts seven affinity groups and three working groups. 
The affinity groups are: Ace/Aro, (Dis)Ability, InQUEERy, Middle Sexualities, Race and Ethnicity, 
Trans and Non-Binary, and Womxn. The three working groups that we have are: (Dis)Ability, Beyond 
the Binary, and Black & Queer. We are always working to improve and would love to know if your 
identity is not being represented. Please do not ever hesitate to reach out and let us know how 
we can improve representation!

We invite you to join any number of our affinity groups based on your intersecting identities. 
Please refer to descriptions below for clarity and use the links provided to express your interest 
in joining. *Note that your information is private and we will never share it without your consent. 
We require that individuals’ identities align with the affinity group for the safety and comfort of 
all members.

If you have any additional questions, please email AJ at [aj.bryant@ostem.org](mailto:aj.bryant@ostem.org)

We welcome you and are so happy you are here!

### (Dis)Ability:

(Dis)Ability aims to provide a space for those with visible and invisible adversities and 
disabilities to come together and discuss ways to manage and overcome them. We discuss ability 
in education, the workplace, and in STEM, as well as how our lived experiences are impacted. By 
sharing our experiences and talking through ways to accommodate, self-advocate, and educate others, 
we come together to demonstrate that we’re more than just our (Dis)Abilities.

### InQUEERy:

InQUEERy is a space in which oSTEM members can: EXPLORE notions of belief, faith, and philosophy; 
QUESTION these notions in critical and respectful ways; and CREATE dialogues that unify us in our 
differences. This group is open to any members in search of meaningful ways to be QUEER and engage 
their SPIRITUALITY.

womxn in education, the workplace, and in STEM, as well as how our lived experiences are impacted. 
By sharing our experiences and talking through ways to accommodate, self-advocate, and educate 
others, we come together to demonstrate that our gender does not limit us, particularly in STEM.

questions, to celebrate our achievements, to build a supportive network, and to advocate for 
greater visibility.

# Resources to Support the Black Lives Matter Movement

## Our Statement to the oSTEM Family,
 
We are speaking out in solidarity with those fighting for the dismantling of white supremacy. As Pride Month and the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots near, we cannot forget that victories of freedom in the United States have been a direct result of movements of civil unrest led by Black people. We cannot stand as idle witnesses to the systemic racism, racial violence, and police brutality taking Black lives every day. We must demand justice and liberation for the Black community in the form of systematic change that values Black life and Black freedom. And we must work towards this change through the resistance of oppression, the protection of the most marginalized, and the redistribution of wealth to those in need. We must say Black Lives Matter. Stay strong. Stay safe.

## Resources

We are committed to actively supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and are working on a document that compiles resources about protests against police violence towards the Black community, as well as donation links and ways to support those on the front lines.

Thank You
Donation Matching
We are so grateful to everyone for helping us reach our donation match goal of $2,500 USD in support of The Okra Project!

We want to give a special shout out to our USC chapter, USC QuEST - Queers in Engineering, Science, and Technology, for also leading their own donation matching efforts to support this organization as well. Though this particular fundraising effort is over, we still want to underscore the importance of sustained support of organizations that are Black-run and Black-serving, so please continue to donate to your capacity using paypal.me/theokraproject or the button below.

Thank you.

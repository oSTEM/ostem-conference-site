## Organizational Advisory Council
Our Organizational Advisory Council (OAC) is a premier partnership opportunity to provide year-round support.  OAC members are able to share their perspective, provide guidance and wisdom, share resources, and receive insight of the upcoming programmatic aspects of oSTEM's mission.  Membership operates on a yearly cycle, from July 1 to June 30. Benefits include:

- Three meetings including one in-person meeting congruent with the Annual oSTEM Conference (includes full conference registrations for representatives)
- Organizational logo in monthly all-member newsletter
- Networking opportunities with OAC representatives at the Executive, Talent Acquisition, and Employee levels

## Conference Sponsorship
Organizations are encouraged to sponsor our Annual Conference and become exhibitors.  Conference sponsors allow us to continue to provide a high standard of excellence while keeping our cost of attendance equitable.  While our sponsorship benefits may change year-to-year, they typically include:

- Spot exhibiting at our Career Fair + Full Conference Registrations
- Resumes/CVs from Conference Attendees
- Access to the oSTEM Career Portal
